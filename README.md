# mastermind-refactor

I've refactored my first program written at Turing — [Mastermind](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown). It's only been three months and already the original makes me cringe. What will I think of my code in a year, five years, ten years?!

### Play Along

Mastermind is a console-based game. To play, download the repo, and type `ruby mastermind.rb`. Enjoy!

### Lessons Learned

Open `mastermind_original.rb` to view the horribly-designed, one-big-loop of a program that I originally designed. 

### Still Growing

See another way to refactor? Email me at [emily@emilydowdle.com](mailto:emily@emilydowdle.com) — I'd love to hear from you.
